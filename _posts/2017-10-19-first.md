This is my first post. 

In this blog, I will comment some experiences and things I am doing, and planning on doing

I will also teach some interesting things here.

### Language

English, primarily. I am Brazilian, but I want to reach the more people I can. And, also, 
practice my english. (This doesn't prevent me to do some posts in Portuguese if i see
that someone I know needs help)

### Projects

I have some interesting projects on my [Github](http://github.com/arthurmco). They include:

 - a mini kernel, for low-end computers
 - a small console-based finance management software
 - a REST-based blogging management, on which you choose the layout (something like Jekyll
itself, but with endpoints instead of files)

### Considerations

So that's it...  
Until the next post
